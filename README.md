# TrainApp

## Overview

A burger logger application made with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars.

## Description

In this application, the user is able to enter a train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. The inputs will be populated onto a table and the calculated next arrival time as well as minutes away will be displayed. Those times are calculated based on the current time.

This application uses the firebase database to store its data. It also uses moment js to acquire, format, and calculate the current and next arrivale times. It was also done using jQuery, javascript, and bootstrap.


This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars. It is built using the MVC framework.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as *Burgers you can eat* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
