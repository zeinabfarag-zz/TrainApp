# TrainApp

In this application, the user is able to enter a train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. The inputs will be populated onto a table and the calculated next arrival time as well as minutes away will be displayed. Those times are calculated based on the current time.

This application uses the firebase database to store its data. It also uses moment js to acquire, format, and calculate the current and next arrivale times. It was also done using jQuery, javascript, and bootstrap.
